  <h1>Privacy Policy – CookieControl</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <p>CookieControl (“we”, “the extension”) is a browser extension that helps you apply your cookie consent preference on websites by interacting with consent banners. This policy describes what data the extension uses and where it stays.</p>

  <h2>Data we store (on your device only)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your consent preference</strong> — e.g. “reject non-essential” or “accept all” — so we can apply it on consent banners.</li>
    <li><strong>Per-site overrides</strong> — if you set a different rule for specific websites.</li>
    <li><strong>Pro status</strong> — whether you have unlocked Pro, so the extension can show the right features.</li>
    <li><strong>Local action log</strong> — a short log of consent actions (e.g. “rejected on example.com”) used only inside the extension to show “last action” and recent activity. This stays on your device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All of the above is stored locally in your browser (Chrome’s extension storage). We do not send this data to our own servers.</p>

  <h2>Data we do not collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, sell, or share your personal data, browsing history, or the content of pages you visit. We do not run analytics or tracking on you.</p>

  <h2>Host and tab access</h2>
  <p>The extension needs permission to run on web pages so it can find and interact with cookie consent banners (e.g. click “Reject” or “Accept” according to your choice). It only looks for known consent UI elements and does not read or transmit page content. Tab access is used only when you click “Re-apply consent” in the popup.</p>

  <h2>Pro payments (ExtensionPay)</h2>
  <p>If you buy Pro, payment is handled by ExtensionPay (extensionpay.com) and Stripe. Their privacy and payment terms apply to that process. We do not receive or store your payment details; we only receive confirmation that your extension user account has Pro access, which we store locally so the extension can unlock Pro features.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the extension after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
